# Video to PDF
This tool can read multiple videos, extract their slides (by a scene detection algorithm from ffmpeg), optionally allow the user to select which slides he wants (option to delete detected slides) and finally merge all slides to a pdf.

Please note that I wrote this tool at one evening for me, as one of my professors didn't release the slides but just the video presentation (a recorded Power Point).
